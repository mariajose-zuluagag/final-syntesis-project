<h3>Astrobiology</h3>
<p>
  <span class="subtitulos">What is astrobiology?</span>
  <br /><br />
  How does life begin and evolve? Is there life in other planets? Are we alone
  in the universe?. For centuries, man has considered these fundamental
  questions about the origin and evolution of life. The Astrobiology is the
  scientific discipline dedicated to responding to these questions.
  <br /><br />
  Astrobiology is the science that focuses on the study and exploration of life
  in the stars. More specifically, the origin, evolution, distribution of life
  in the universe, the search for habitable planets and how humans can know
  them, if it exists. Other facts that it study for understand, are the
  conditions and processes that make it possible for life to appear in our
  planet. Astrobiology uses a variety of scientific disciplines such as
  astrophysics, planetary sciences, atmospheric sciences, geology, chemistry,
  evolutionary biology, molecular biology and others. The previous ones provide
  the theoretical support to this branches of knowledge.
  <br /><br />
  In order to advance with its task, astrobiology examines extreme ecosystems on
  Earth, such as poles and thermal vents, studying the microorganisms that habit
  in them, as they can provide clues about how life could survive in extreme
  conditions on other planets.
